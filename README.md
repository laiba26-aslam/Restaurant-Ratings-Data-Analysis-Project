This project analyzes a restaurant dataset to uncover insights into customer ratings, location patterns, popular cuisines, and more. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, the data was cleaned, explored, and visualized to answer key analytical questions, such as:

Which cities have the most listed restaurants?

What are the top-rated restaurants and cuisines?

Does online delivery affect customer ratings?

What types of restaurants generally receive higher ratings?

# findings
**Total Sales** amounted to $1,201,681, with 8,523 items sold and an average sales value of $141.

The **average customer rating** across products is 4.0, indicating high overall satisfaction.

**Low Fat** items generated the highest sales among fat content categories, highlighting consumer preference for healthier options.

Snack Foods, Dairy, and Fruits & Vegetables were the top-selling item types.

**Outlets established** in 1985 and 1999 showed strong and consistent sales over the years.

Small-sized outlets generated the majority of revenue, suggesting that smaller formats can still achieve high sales efficiency.

Locations classified as Tier 1 (Urban) had the **highest total sales**, followed by Tier 2 cities, reflecting urban market dominance.

Outlet Size and Location Type play a significant role in sales performance.

Data cleaning was necessary to standardize fat content categories, improving accuracy in grouped analysis.


 

# conclusion 
This project delivers meaningful insights into restaurant performance by analyzing sales and ratings data from various perspectives, including item types, fat content, outlet size, and location.
Key perormance indicators show that:
The business achieved total sales of $1,201,681 through 8,523 items sold, with an average rating of 4.0, reflecting strong customer satisfaction.
Low Fat items generated a majority of the sales, indicating health-conscious customer preferences.
Among all item types, a few categories such as Snack Foods and Fruits & Vegetables contributed significantly to revenue.
Outlets established in earlier years (e.g., 1985, 1999) still perform strongly, showing sustained business presence.
Small-sized outlets surprisingly contribute a large portion of sales, showing that size doesnâ€™t always limit performance.
Sales are highest in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities, where urban demand and accessibility support strong performance.
Overall, the analysis suggests that maintaining product diversity, focusing on popular item types, and strategically expanding in high-performing locations can further improve business outcomes. The combination of high sales, strong ratings, and clear customer preferences offers valuable direction for future growth and decision-making
